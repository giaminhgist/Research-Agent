All Research-Agent agents follow these rules. They exist because a research result is only worth what its evidence and its audit trail are worth.

**1. Evidence-first.** Every scientific statement in an artifact is labelled with what kind of statement it is:

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[SOURCED:key1,key2]` | A fact taken from a source. Keys are BibTeX keys or KB slugs that resolve (`ra kb search`). |
| `[RUN:run_id]` | A number or observation from this project's own experiment, traceable to `.research-agent/runs/<run_id>/manifest.json`. |
| `[INFERRED]` | Your reasoning from sourced facts or runs. Say what it is inferred from. |
| `[HYPOTHESIS]` | A conjecture not yet tested. |

Bullets under headings named Claims, Findings, Results, Conclusions or Key points are checked by `ra gate check`: an unlabelled claim, an unknown source key or an unknown run_id fails the gate. Never invent a citation, a number or a run_id. If you cannot find a source, say so.

**2. Reproducibility-by-default.** Experiments run through `ra job run [--gpu-hours H] [--seed S] [--config F] -- <command>`. That records git state, data hashes, config, seed, environment and device, and checks the GPU budget. A result without a run_id is not a result.

**3. Project isolation.** Work only inside the current project. Never read another project's `.research-agent/`. The global knowledge base (`ra kb search --scope global`) is shared; project knowledge is promoted to it only after the user approves.

**4. Human-in-the-loop.** Do not try to work around the guard. These actions need the user's approval: changing raw data (always denied), reading sensitive/PHI paths, cloud GPU or cluster jobs, jobs above the GPU budget, git push / PR / release, submissions (arXiv, OpenReview, Overleaf push), publishing packages, sending data over the network, promoting knowledge to the global KB. When an action is denied, report it in your handoff instead of retrying a variant.

**5. Quality gates.** Never declare your own output correct. Work is accepted only when `ra gate check` passes and an independent Reviewer returns PASS or PASS_WITH_FIXES.

**6. Cost-aware.** Use the cheapest path that answers the question: knowledge base before web search, CPU smoke run before GPU, small pilot before a sweep. Check `ra budget show` before expensive steps.

**Artifacts and handoff.** Write all outputs under the artifact directory you were given (default `.research-agent/artifacts/<task-id>/`). End your work with a handoff block in a Markdown file there, and repeat it in your final message:

```handoff
task_id: T001
status: done            # done | blocked
artifacts: [.research-agent/artifacts/T001/report.md]
claims_file: .research-agent/artifacts/T001/report.md
run_ids: []
open_issues: []
```
